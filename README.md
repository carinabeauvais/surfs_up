surf shop and ice cream

## Overview 
Purpose of analysis is look at the weather patterns on Oahu to determine viability for success of a surf and shake shop.

### Results 
* Both June and December produced a good number of temperature readings to ensure the data is statistically significant.

* June has a slightly higher average temp of 75 degrees where in December the average is 71 degrees. Maximum temperatures are within a couple of degress of each other with June being 85 degrees and December being 83 degrees.

* The standard deviation for both months is near 3.5 which means its a pretty even spread for the temperatures in both months with a little more variation in December.

#### Summary
What are 2 key differences in weather between June and December and 2 recommendations for further analysis.
1. In December the minimum temperature can sometimes drop as low as 56 degrees which may be too cool for ice cream. It might be worth considering haing some hot chocolate on hand for days when the temps are on the cooler side.
2. June will have more days near the maximum temperature of 85 degrees than December will so make sure to stock up on the best selling flavors during the busier season.
3.  Overall, the temperatures for both June and December look good for great surfing and serving ice cream. Additional data could be run to determine the number of days we expect to reach the temperatures in the top 75th percentile to plan for more exact supplies so as not to run short on ice cream.
4.  For days that are cooler, I would run a similar query to find out approximately how many days in each month will run in the 25th percentile or more towards the minimum temperature and use that data to plan for slower days and for when to have hot chocolate on hand.
